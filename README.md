# FishBrook

## Project Description

This project serves as a static frontend as part of a RESTful application

FishBrook is a lighthearted social website for anglers who share a passion for fishing. Anglers can log in and upload the fish they catch (and the gear they used to catch them) to FishBrook. They can also view the fish that other anglers caught by viewing all catches or viewing catches by leaderboard, person, or group. Speaking of groups, anglers can create, join, and leave groups to promote social interaction. Viewing a catch will show the fish, the angler who caught it, the gear used to catch it, and the time and place it was caught.
